### Linked List Front-end

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Create your own repository on github and change the remote `git remote rm origin` and then `git remote add origin _______`.
3.  `npm install`
4.  `npm start`

Make sure you have a server running on port 8081 so that the front-end can use it as a proxy.
